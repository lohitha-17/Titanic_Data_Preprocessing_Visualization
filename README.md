# Titanic_Data_Preprocessing_Visualization
Exploration of data preprocessing and visualization techniques using the Titanic dataset. This project focuses on cleaning data, handling missing values, performing feature engineering, and creating insightful visualizations to understand survival trends among passengers. Ideal for showcasing essential skills in data analysis and visualization.
## Features
- Handled missing data and performed feature engineering.
- Encoded categorical variables for analysis.
- Visualized survival trends by age, gender, class, and other features.
- Created new features (e.g., family size) for further analysis.

## Dataset
- [Titanic Dataset](https://www.openml.org/data/download/16826755/phpMYEkMl) from OpenML.
- Contains passenger details such as age, gender, fare, class, survival status, etc.
